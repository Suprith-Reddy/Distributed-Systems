Problem description:
The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of Asynchronous gossip algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in F#. 

Implementation:
Algorithms used: Gossip algorithm and Push Sum algorithm
Topologies used : Full, 2D, imperfect 2D and line

Working: 
Below are the largest no. of nodes in the network and Convergence time for each type of topology and algorithm:

For the gossip algorithm:
Full topology : 50000 nodes with convergence time of 134300ms
2D topology : 50000 nodes with convergence time of 148560ms
Imp 2D topology : 50000 nodes with convergence time of 146722ms
Line topology: 50000 nodes with convergence time of 200908ms

For the push Sum algorithm:
Full topology : 3000 nodes with convergence time of 7583ms
2D topology : 3000 nodes with convergence time of 7698ms
Imp 2D topology : 3000 nodes with convergence time of 3772ms
Line topology: 3000 nodes with convergence time of 42709ms
